Response to Exercise 1: While sys_getpid () will eventually get called again,
the register values will also have changed and sys_getpid () will not return
the correct value.

Response to Exercise 3: I added a p_wait value for to the process data
structure. All processes initially have a a p_wait value of -5. If a process
needs to wait it will have a value not equal to -5. The schedule() function
will attempt to run blocked processes and will change their blocked state
once they are able to finish.

Response to Exercise 4: I never changed the state of the zombie processes to
P_EMPTY so the kernel was limited to only running a few processes.
