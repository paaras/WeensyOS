WeensyOS
=================
The WeensyOS problem sets are a series of little coding exercises that are also complete operating systems.

Part 1
------------
The first WeensyOS problem set concerns processes. The MiniprocOS is a tiny operating system that supports the major process primitives: creating a new process with fork, exiting a process, and waiting on a process that has exited.

Part 2
-------------------
The second WeensyOS problem set shows off scheduling and synchronization.

Specifically I implemented:
* strict priority scheduling
* round robin scheduling
* write atomicity
